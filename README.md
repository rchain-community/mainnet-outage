# Mainnet-Outage
TEST
There can be two types of outages:  short term and long term.

## Short Term 

Short term is defined as an interruption or temporary loss of power or signal flow that can be rectified in a matter of minutes by intervention of a systems operator.

## Long Term

Long term is defined as a stoppage in the functioning of a machine or mechanism due to a component failure that requires manual replacement of one or more integral parts to correct the problem.


In both instances, an After Action Report (AAR) should be filed to document the time the outage occurred, the time it was rectified, the nature of the problem and what steps were taken to correct the problem.  The AAR can be used to track problems in the system so steps can be taken to mitigate future occurrences.
