# Mainnet-Outage

There can be two types of outages:  short term and long term.

## Short Term 

Short term is defined as an interruption or temporary loss of power or signal flow that can be rectified in a matter of minutes by intervention of a systems operator.

## Long Term

Long term is defined as a stoppage in the functioning of a machine or mechanism due to a component failure that requires manual replacement of one or more integral parts to correct the problem.


In both instances, an After Action Report (AAR) should be filed to document the time the outage occurred, the time it was rectified, the nature of the problem and what steps were taken to correct the problem.  The AAR can be used to track problems in the system so steps can be taken to mitigate future occurrences.

# AAR {After Action Report/Review}

The purpose of this AAR is to review the effectiveness of the monitoring program for the RHOVISION project. The AAR will identify areas where the monitoring program is performing well and areas where it could be improved.

After Action Report, is a process for reviewing and reflecting on an event or activity. It is a valuable tool for improving performance and identifying areas for improvement. An AAR for monitoring can be used to review the effectiveness of a monitoring program and identify areas where the program can be improved.

The following are some of the key benefits of conducting an AAR for monitoring:

*Improved performance

*Identification of areas for improvement

*Increased understanding of the monitoring program

These are some of the key words found in the github "mainnet outages" repository AAR for the monitoring team and their purpose:
